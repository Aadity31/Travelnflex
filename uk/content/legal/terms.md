The Company’s role is limited to listing service offerings, facilitating discovery and bookings, enabling payment facilitation in certain cases, and providing a basic dispute facilitation mechanism.

Nothing contained on the Platform shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between the Company and any Service Provider.

While the Platform may assist in itinerary curation, payment facilitation, or dispute communication, such assistance is administrative and facilitative in nature only.

The Company does not assume responsibility for the quality, safety, legality, suitability, or execution of any services, nor for the acts or omissions of Service Providers.

Service execution remains the sole responsibility of the respective Service Provider.

Service Providers listed on the Platform are independent entities.

The Company may conduct limited verification of Service Providers, including identity verification (KYC) and collection of self-declared licenses, registrations, or permits.

Depending on the transaction structure, payments may be made directly to Service Providers or may be collected by the Platform as a payment facilitator.

The Company does not act as a trustee, escrow agent, insurer, or guarantor.

Release of funds to a Service Provider does not imply acceptance, approval, or confirmation of service quality or completion.

## 7. Cancellations, Refunds, and Dispute Facilitation

Cancellation and refund terms are primarily governed by the applicable Service Provider’s policy as communicated or displayed at the time of booking.

The Platform may facilitate communication between Users and Service Providers, assist in dispute resolution, or process refunds where appropriate, without admitting liability.

Refunds are not guaranteed and are subject to Service Provider policies, the nature of the dispute, and applicable laws.

Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes statutory consumer rights available under applicable Indian law.
