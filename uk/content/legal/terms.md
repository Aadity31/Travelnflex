## Quick Overview (Plain Language Summary)

The Platform connects travelers with independent travel agencies and service providers. We do not operate travel services ourselves.

## 1. Nature and Scope of the Platform

The Platform is a technology-enabled marketplace that facilitates interaction between travelers or customers (“Users”) and independent third-party travel agencies, tour operators, guides, and service providers (“Service Providers”).

The Company does not itself provide travel services. All travel-related services are offered, operated, and executed solely by independent Service Providers.

The Company’s role is limited to listing service offerings, facilitating discovery and bookings, enabling payment facilitation in certain cases, and providing a basic dispute facilitation mechanism.

Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between the Company and any Service Provider.

## 2. Limited Facilitation Disclaimer

While the Platform may assist in itinerary curation, payment facilitation, or dispute communication, such assistance is administrative and facilitative in nature only.

The Company does not assume responsibility for the quality, safety, legality, suitability, or execution of any services, nor for the acts or omissions of Service Providers.

Service execution remains the sole responsibility of the respective Service Provider.

## 5. Service Providers and Limited Verification

Service Providers listed on the Platform are independent entities.

The Company may conduct limited verification of Service Providers, including identity verification (KYC) and collection of self-declared licenses, registrations, or permits.

Users acknowledge that reliance on Service Providers is at their own risk.

## 6. Payments and Platform Role

Depending on the transaction structure, payments may be made directly to Service Providers or may be collected by the Platform as a payment facilitator.

The Company does not act as a trustee, escrow agent, insurer, or guarantor.

Release of funds to a Service Provider does not imply acceptance, approval, or confirmation of service quality or completion.

---

## 7. Cancellations, Refunds, and Dispute Facilitation

Cancellation and refund terms are primarily governed by the applicable Service Provider’s policy as communicated or displayed at the time of booking.

The Platform may facilitate communication between Users and Service Providers, assist in dispute resolution, or process refunds where appropriate, without admitting liability.

Refunds are not guaranteed and are subject to Service Provider policies, the nature of the dispute, and applicable laws.

Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes statutory consumer rights available under applicable Indian law.
